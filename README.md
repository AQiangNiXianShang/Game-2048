# Game-2048
This repository tries to implement the Game 2048 in Android using Jetpack Compose. It also uses libraries like Room DB and Kotlinx Serialization to save state of game when app is sent to background or app is killed etc.

You can download a sample app using link: https://bit.ly/3BIgkOq

Currently, this app is not complete implementation and improvements are in progress but still it can be played as it is.
